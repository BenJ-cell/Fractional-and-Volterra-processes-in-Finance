# Fractional-and-Volterra-processes-in-Finance

Empirical studies indicate the presence of memory and strong intertemporal dependence in various phenomena in finance and economics. Brownian motion, characterized by independent increments, is not suitable for modeling such phenomena. In this course, we will consider Volterra stochastic processes: a class of processes that extends standard Brownian motion to include memory; fractional Brownian motion is a special case.

We developped the mathematical tools needed to deal with these (non-standard) Volterra integral equations, which go beyond the standard theory of stochastic calculus for Markov processes and semimartingales.

And we explored the modeling flexibility of such equations by introducing memory into a wide range of financial problems, including:

  Interest rates with short and long memory: fast pricing of interest rate products.
  Rough stochastic volatility models: fast evaluation and calibration via Fourier inversion techniques; analytical solutions for the Markowitz portfolio allocation problem with several rough volatility assets.
  Optimal execution and liquidation with transient market impact.
